# Router-scroll-demo

Take a trip on the [Yellow Submarine](https://dollarshaveclub.github.io/router-scroll-demo)! This is a simple Ember.js app demonstrating the functionality of the [Ember-router-scroll](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/ember-router-scroll) addon used on [dollarshaveclub.com](https://www.dollarshaveclub.com).

### Scrollin'
Ember-router-scroll allows your single-page app to behave like a multi-page website
* Transitioning to a new route will take you to the top of the page.
* Using the browser's back or forward buttons will preserve your scroll position.

This app was deployed to Github Pages using the [ember-cli-github-pages](https://github.com/poetic/ember-cli-github-pages) addon.
